    "summary": "I'm a highly motivated person who strives for the best. I'm able to grasp bigger concepts both technically and organizationally. I strive to take ownership and value it in my teammates. I believe that all problems have solutions and that they can be found through discussion, understanding, and compassion. \n\n I have experience and knowledge in web development technologies, and I am constantly learning new things during my daily work and during my spare time. I am able to take on bigger and complex challenges. I constantly find myself in situations outside my comfort zone, where I am not familiar with the technologies or the domain. \n\nAreas I exceed include learning new things fast, creating a common understanding together with everyone involved, and making teams perform together through constant improvement.",
