    "summary": "I'm a fullstack web developer who is striving to do my best. Being a team player is important to me and I enjoy taking ownership of things. I strongly believe that all problems have solutions and that they can be found through discussion and understanding. Due to this I often find myself gravitating towards the role of improving the ways of working of the team, and by that, improving effectiveness of the team to reach the common goal. I'm comfortable with full-stack web development technologies and being a jack of all trades is really important to me.",
