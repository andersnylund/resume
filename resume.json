    "summary": "A highly motivated person who constantly strives for the best. I am highly technical and able to grasp bigger concepts both technically and organizationally. Taking ownership is something I value and strive for. I believe that any problem has a solution and that it can be found through discussion, understanding, and compassion. \n\n I have broad and firm experience and knowledge in web development technologies, and I am constantly learning new things during my daily work and during my free time. I am able to take on bigger and complex challenges. If I stumble on something I am not familiar with I completely throw myself in it and learn how it works. \n\nAreas I exceed include learning new things fast, creating a common understanding together with everyone involved, and making teams perform together through constant improvement.",
